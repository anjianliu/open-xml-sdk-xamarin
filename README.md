# Open-XML-SDK-Xamarin

A version of the [Microsoft Open Xml Sdk](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) that replaces the dependencies in WindowBase to work with Xamarin for iOS and Android.

The Open XML SDK provides open-source libraries for working with Open XML Documents (DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX). It supports scenarios such as:

High-performance generation of word-processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations
Document modification, such as removing tracked revisions or removing unacceptable content from documents
Data and content querying and extraction, such as transformation from DOCX to HTML, or extraction of data from spreadsheets
